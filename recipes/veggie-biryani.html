        Ingredients needed
    </h3>
    
    <ul>
        <li>250g basmati rice</li>
        <li>400g special mixed frozen vegetables</li>
        <li>a generous handful of raisins</li>
        <li>1 vegetable stock cube</li>
        <li>2 tbsp korma curry paste</li>
        <li>a generous handful of roasted salted cashew nuts</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Method</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Boil the kettle. Get out a large microwaveable bowl and pile in the rice, veg and raisins.
        </li>
        <li>
            Pour 600ml/1 pint boiling water over the rice mixture and crumble in the stock cube,
             then stir in the curry paste. Cover the bowl with cling film,
              leaving a small gap at the side to let out the steam.
               Cook on full power (850 watts) for 12 minutes if your microwave is less powerful,
               add 2 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Remove from the microwave and stand, still covered,
             for 5 minutes to complete the cooking if you donâ€™t let it stand the rice will be too nutty.
             Fluff up the rice, scatter with cashews and serve.
        </li>
    </ol>
